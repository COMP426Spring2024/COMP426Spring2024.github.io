  <title>Images Example</title>
 </head>

 <body>
  <p>Images are included within the flow of the text so
     the image tag is nested within the paragraph tag.
     Like this: <img width="50" src="http://www.cs.unc.edu/~kmp/kmp.jpg" alt="Ketan in the office." title="K in the office">
  </p>

  <p>The &lt;figure&gt; and &lt;figcaption&gt; tags were introduced in HTML 5
     to help support grouping an image with its caption together like this:
  </p>

  <figure>
    <img src="http://www.cs.unc.edu/~kmp/kmp.jpg" alt="In my office">
    <figcaption>If you don't specify dimensions, then you get the picture's native size.</figcaption>
  </figure>
